NFS
###
[m
- currently the initial nfs-mount is done in funktion "mountroot ()" in script INITRD/scripts/nfs *)
- this function is called from INITRD/init
- the resulting mount inside a running client on base 1.0.0-36 looks like this


root@DD-Buero-1697:~# cat /proc/mounts  | grep nfs 
10.224.129.2:/openthinclient /var/tcos nfs ro,vers=2,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,namlen=255,hard,nointr,nolock,proto=udp,timeo=7,retrans=10,sec=sys,addr=10.224.129.2 0 0

* Keep in mind, that there is a second function called "mountroot ()" in script INITRD/scripts/local, but this funtion seems to be used in case of localboot

[1m
SFS and AUFS
#############
[m

- the base.sfs and all other sfs-files are mounted in the script INITRD/scripts/init-bottom/tcos_aufs 
- so far nothing special: "mount -t squashfs -o loop,ro "$BASE_FILE" /base" 

root@DD-Buero-1697:~# cat /proc/mounts  | grep base
/dev/loop0 /var/sfs/base squashfs ro 0 0

- then the aufs comes into game

# mount union
mount -t aufs -o nowarn_perm,br:/rw=rw:$BRANCHES aufs ${rootmnt}

- the package sfs-files are mounted on top of the aufs --> each to /opt/packagename
- example: /dev/loop1 /var/sfs/module/desktop-module squashfs ro 0 0

CONSIDERATION
##############
[m

- let's use (adapt) some code of INITRD/scripts/init-bottom/tcos_aufs 
- we do not need to move the mounts like tcos_aufs does as long as we go Klaus' way (softlinking folders back to /)
- merged the old an the new way it might look as follows

[1m
/ (rootfs)
/bin   ->         /union/bin
/etc   ->         /union/etc
/home  ->         /union/home
/lib   ->         /union/lib
/media
	/to/local      (flashdrive, nfs-to-local-copy, hdd)
/root  ->         /union/root
/union            aufs rw,si=502d7e5b,...............
/usr   ->         /union/usr
/sbin  ->         /union/sbin
/opt   ->         /union/opt

# the underlaying stuff
/tcos/link 	nfs		OTC-Server:/openthinclient # the initial one!
/tcos/write	 		# for aufs to write this is just a folder inside the /
/tcos/base     	squashfs 	# via loopback sfs-file: /tcos/link/sfs/base.sfs

# the packages
/tcos/packages/opt/packagename1  squashfs 	# via loopback sfs-file: /tcos/link/sfs/package/packagename1.sfs
/tcos/packages/opt/packagename2  squashfs 	# via loopback sfs-file: /tcos/link/sfs/package/packagename2.sfs


"->" are links to be set

[m

- the old way to have module-sfs is actually not covered
